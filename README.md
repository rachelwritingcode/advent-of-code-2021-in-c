## Advent of code 2021
What's the best way to learn (or in my case, re-learn) a programming language? Take up the advent of code challenge! 🎄🎅
I'm going back in time, doing a bit of time travelling and starting from 2021 ⏳! Great prep for AoC 2023 as December is just around the corner! 

Yours Truly,
